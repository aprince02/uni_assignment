# Software Engineering & Agile Development Assignment

This repository contains the source code for the Web Database Application that I am creating using NodeJS and SQLite for my university assignment.

The application is used to initiate payments that need to be paid to the claimants. Within the application, you can update the claimant details including first name, last name, date of birth, sort code, and account number. You are also able to add new claimants, and depending on if you are logged in as an administrator, delete claimants. There is a login page, which will only grant access to further pages within the application after a successful login. You are also able to register as a new user to the application with a unique email and password. 

## Using the application
